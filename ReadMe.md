üî• **7 Days to Die ‚Äì Biome Progression Rework**

üéØ **Core Concept**
Introduce a biome-specific progression system tied to armor mods and trader quests that rewards players for surviving in progressively harder environments. Replaces the static biome difficulty system with something more immersive and modular.

üõ°Ô∏è **Armor Mod Slot Progression**
‚Ä¢ No biome slots on primitive armor  
‚Ä¢ Tier 3+ class armor gains specialized biome mod slots  
‚Ä¢ Each slot only accepts mods for the specific biome  
‚Ä¢ Mods must be earned through trader quests (not looted or crafted)

**Armor Tier Unlocks:**
‚Ä¢ Tier 3 ‚Äì Burnt Forest  
‚Ä¢ Tier 4 ‚Äì Desert  
‚Ä¢ Tier 5 ‚Äì Snow  
‚Ä¢ Tier 6 ‚Äì Wasteland  

üß© **Biome Mod System**
Each biome has **4 armor mods** (Helmet, Chest, Gloves, Boots)

**Effects:**
‚Ä¢ Each equipped mod:  
   ‚Ü≥ Increases hazard resistance timer  
   ‚Ü≥ Decreases cooldown for resistance reset  
‚Ä¢ Wearing all 4:  
   ‚Ü≥ Grants full immunity to biome hazards  
   ‚Ü≥ *(Optional)* Unlocks minor passive bonuses (e.g. faster movement, better loot)

**Example ‚Äì Desert Mods:**
| Slot   | Mod Name           | Effect                                  |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Helmet | Sand Filter Visor  | Reduces dehydration buildup              |
| Chest  | Ventilated Plates  | Max loot stage increase (all biomes)     |
| Gloves | Desert Wraps       | Damage increase vs. Plague Spitters      |
| Boots  | Sandstep Soles     | Reduces stamina drain while sprinting    |

üß≠ **Biome Quests (Replacing Challenges)**
‚Ä¢ Each biome has **4 quests**, 1 per armor mod  
‚Ä¢ Quests are **available from any trader**  
‚Ä¢ Can be accepted anytime ‚Äì encourages flexible progression  
‚Ä¢ Completing a quest rewards the related biome mod  

**Example ‚Äì Snow Biome Quests:**
| Quest Name         | Objective                            | Reward                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cold Storage       | Retrieve supplies from a frozen POI   | Helmet Mod: Frost Visor       |
| Shiver Me Timber   | Clear the Lumber Mill                 | Chest Mod: Heated Plates      |
| Frozen Tracks      | Kill 15 Mountain Lions                | Gloves Mod: Thermal Wraps     |
| Ice Breaker        | Collect 1,000 Snow                    | Boots Mod: Insulated Boots    |
